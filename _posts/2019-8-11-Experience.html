  <dd>
    <p>At first I was quite confused what to apply for BIOS or FOSS, however i do think I made the right decision, cppyling to FOSS as it was the reason for me to comlpete all the small dreams<br />
    This was quite a experience, coding day and night, coding while travelling was all a dream which has finally come true.Wished i had a hoodie at times, to have that hacker look tho :) <br />
    I did have a blog that I created when I was a kid from the templates in weebly at that time, hoever never felt that was enough.There was this FOSS task to create a blog, and to be honest I am quite satisfied with what I've done.Hope I just improve from here</p>

    <dt><h2>Before knowing about FOSS</h2></dt>
      <dd>
          <p>It was my dream to be a coder, and during my 9th grade I learnt HTML through some videos on Youtube.However all that came to an end during 10<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> grade.Learnt C++ during the last two yars of school, but I was not able to make practical usage of it due to all the JEE coaching classes I had.<br />
          It took some time for me to accept the fact I would be joining Amrita, but after reading some answers on quora about FOSS I felt maybe this is what might be perfect for me.In that enthusiasm I learned a bit of python3 from Youtube and tried building soome basic programs.</p>

     <dt><h2>After doing the FOSS tasks</h2></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>FOSS was one of the reasons why I so glad about myself.After my 10<sup>th</sup> grade, to be honest I was never proud of myself. It was a series of constant failures. However after doing all tasks, staying up late just to get them done, I actually feel proud of myself and what I have done in the last couple of weeks.I am really grateful for this</p>

     <dt><h2>If I get into FOSS</h2></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Getting into FOSS would be a dream come true.Developing apps and websites is my dream and there is no better place than FOSS that would help me acheive it. However getting in FOSS would not be the end. My dedication towards the club and towards acheiving my dream would be twice as much it has been untill now.</p>

       <dt><h2>If I do not get into FOSS</h2></dt> 
       <dd>
       <p>This would not be the end of my journey, I would code and try to improve my skills in order to get into FOSS the next semester.I know it sounds weird but this is something I really want.

  <dd> 
      <dl>
      <dt><h2>Task 3</h2></dt>
      <dd>
          <p> I could not complete this task due as I left it for the last.This code is done midway and I have included it in Gighub repo but not in the the tasks completed page.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><h2>Task 5, Task 6 and Task 10  </h2></dt>
       <dd>
       <p> Really wanted to do these tasks but due to all the assignments I was dumped with could not do so. There are days in which I slept at 3 in order to complete the tasks.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><h2>Task 4  </h2></dt>
       <dd>
           <p> Tried a lot to complete this task however when I could not figure it out. While running the program it always showed error. Maybe cause I used python3. Did not actually figure that out and kept it aside for the last thing I would do.</p>

   <dt><h3>My Mentor</h3></dt>
   <dd>
       <p>I know this is not necessary, but it is something I wanna add.<br /> I was very lucky to have a mentor with so much passion. At any point of the day he would be available and was always ready to take a look at my codes. Moreover he would also suggest what more I could do to improve what I have done, and what more I could do. I'm not revealing the name cause I have not asked his permission to do so, maybe will update it later.</p>
