    <dt><h2>Task 0 - Install Ubuntu 18.04 </h2></dt>
      <dd>
	      <p>The task was to install Ubuntu 18.04.</p>
         <dl>
		 <dt><strong><h3>Task Description</strong></h3></dt>
        	<dd>
          	This task was basically to install Ubuntu and use it as the main operating system to perform the tasks. This was suggested as CUI (<em>Common User Interface</em>)enables programmers to write a single application that can be compiled for each platform.<br /> More importantly it significantly reducing development effort and the command line is a much more direct way to interact.
          	</dd>
		 <dt><h3><strong>How task was completed</strong></h3></dt>
        	<dd>
          	<p>Task took more time than expected to be completed due to the slow internet connection which made downloading ISO file a long process.
        From there everything when pretty smooth.Made a partition of 300GB for it and followed the instructions to complete the task.</p>

		<dt><h3><strong>Blockers</strong></h3></dt>
		<dd>
			<p>Some major blockers are:<br />
						      
				<ul>
					<li>Blocker 1: There was this data type called verctor. Googled it and read about it, learnt it was a dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted.But could not figure out its usage.Hence had to learn python, I knew the basics as I watched some videos on it during the vacation</li>
					<li>Blocker 2 : Could not figure out the logic behind the Code forces problem.Hence I have not completed it.</li>
					<li>Blocker 3: Took quite some time for the time conversion task, due to its various cases.</li>
				</ul>
